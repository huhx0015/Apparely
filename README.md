Foodgasm | AT&T Mobile App Hackathon Bay Area
============

Team: Michael Huh, Ssurey Moon, Missy Bur

Platform: Android

Foodgasm is a mobile app that entices user's appeal to food and also helps promote business for local restaurants in the area that have food that is trending on social media. With Foodgasm if you can SEE it you can EAT it!

We think that this app would be great for businesses because it will direct traffic from social media directly to locations in the area allowing them to have potential business that would not have been made possible without the power of social media images that are online.
