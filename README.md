## Description

Foodgasm is a mobile app that entices user's appeal to food and also helps promote business for local restaurants in the area that have food that is trending on social media. With Foodgasm if you can SEE it you can EAT it!

We think that this app would be great for businesses because it will direct traffic from social media directly to locations in the area allowing them to have potential business that would not have been made possible without the power of social media images that are online. 

Foodgasm taps into the Reddit and Yelp APIs to retrieve trending food images and the list of nearest restaurants in the area that are associated with each food image.
